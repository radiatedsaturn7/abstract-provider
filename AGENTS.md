If you are told to work on this repository:
1. Open TODO.txt.
2. Run `go mod tidy` and make sure it succeeds. If it fails, fix what you can so that `go mod tidy` works before starting other tasks. If network restrictions or missing modules prevent success, note the failing dependencies in TODO.txt and commit any progress.
3. Run `go test ./...` and make sure it succeeds. If it fails, fix what you can so that the tests pass before other work. If failures are due to missing dependencies, record them in TODO.txt. Commit even partial fixes if necessary.
4. Pick the first unchecked item.
5. Implement that task in the codebase.
6. When the task is complete, mark it as done by replacing "[ ]" with "[x]" in TODO.txt.
7. Commit your changes with a message describing the work.
